		<h1>A little bit about me:</h1>
			</stlye>
		</p>
		<p>Hello I am Danielle Isles Martin and I hope to be a professional problem solver. <br>
			For a long time computers and all things technology have caused me more problems than solved. <br>
			In this new age of technology I no longer wish to be ignorant and learn how IT works<br>
			(get it? I.T.) <br>
			I hope to use the new skills I will gain here to start my new career solving problemsâ€¦ <br>
			most of them my own. </p>
